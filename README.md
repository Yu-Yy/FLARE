## üîç Overview

**FLARE** is a fingerprint recognition framework designed for robust and efficient matching using fixed-length dense descriptors. It integrates:

- üß† **Dense Descriptor** (to be released upon acceptance)
- üß© **Pose-Aware Alignment** (via [FLARE-Align](https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/DRACO))
- üß™ **Robust Enhancement** (via [FLARE-Enh](https://github.com/Yu-Yy/FLARE_ENH))

This repository currently contains references and links to the **pose estimation** and **enhancement** modules only.  
The core code for descriptor extraction and matching will be released **after the paper is accepted**.
